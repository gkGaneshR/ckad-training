# Exercise I

## WP + MariaDB with Canary

Create the K8s resources you need to deploy a WP site on your cluster using
MariaDB as database with the characteristics below:

* All the resources should be created under the *exercise-01* namespace
* The WP site should use a MariaDB database
* Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to configure both MariaDB and WP
* Every container should have the proper readiness and liveness probes
configured
* Use a canary deployment for WP. Consider the version 4.9.7 as the stable WP
version and use 4.9.8 in the canary deployment
* Wordpress should be publicly available while MariaDB should only be accessible
internally (you can consider your cluster supports LoadBalancer service type)

### What to deliver

* *README.md* file with a description about the solution you developed and how to
use it. Please be as descriptive as possible and user "Markdown syntax"
* YAML/JSON files with the definitions of every requested K8s object. Templates
are provided.
* If you created your resources from the command line, attach a bash script with
the commands used to create them. Sth like:

```
#!/bin/bash

## Create ns
kubectl create ns ...

## Create secrets
kubectl create secret generic ...
```

Use the structure below on your PR To GitHub:

```
|
|-/session-01
|-/session-01/exercise-01/
|-/session-01/exercise-01/README.md
|-/session-01/exercise-01/commands.bash
|-/session-01/exercise-01/*.{json,yaml}
```

### Tips

* Use a linter to avoid syntax errors on your YAML/JSON files

### Notes

You need to guarantee Session Affinity when using Canary Deployments. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#proxy-mode-ipvs

## Solution

Random passwords:

```
# openssl rand -hex $(echo $RANDOM %22 +32 | bc)
```

Custom readiness and liveness were created to ensure the correct state of the pods, example:

Status database
```
# mysql -u $MARIADB_USER -p$MARIADB_PASSWORD -e 'SHOW GLOBAL STATUS;'
```

Check if pid exists
```
# kill -0 $(cat /opt/bitnami/mariadb/tmp/mysqld.pid)
```

Check if local web is ok, need -c 1 to return a valid error
```
# curl -I localhost:80 | grep -c 1
```
